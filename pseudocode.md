TODO Your pseudocode goes here!

Hello,

Here is my pseudocode to sort a pile of books in alphabetical order.

State:

N = 1

Pseudo-code:

1. Find the smallest book in the pile of books expect the N first books.
2. If this book is the N-th book, skip to step 4, else continue.
3. Swap this book with the the N-th book.
4. Increase N by 1.
5. If there is the N-th book is not the last book, return to step 1.
6. Else, the pile of books is sorted.
